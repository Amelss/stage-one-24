        <h1>My Goals</h1>
        <p class="goals">
          
Over the next two years, my primary goal is to significantly advance my skills as a frontend developer. I aim to deepen my understanding of modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries, ensuring proficiency in React, NextJS and Typescript. Building upon my existing knowledge, I plan to undertake more complex projects, focusing particularly on creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces that enhance user experience and accessibility. A key part of my plan is to create two custom Shopify theme templates, showcasing my ability to develop tailored e-commerce solutions. This growth will be complemented by honing my design skills, ensuring that every frontend I develop not only functions flawlessly but also boasts a polished and intuitive user interface. </p>

<p class="goals">Additionally, I am eager to expand my expertise in building Contentful CMS sites. By leveraging Contentful's flexible content management capabilities, I aim to develop websites that are not only visually appealing but also structured for easy content management and scaling. My objective is to handle diverse content types seamlessly, integrating them into robust web applications that meet both client and user needs effectively. This pursuit aligns with my commitment to mastering versatile content management systems, equipping me to deliver tailored solutions across various industries and project scopes.</p>

<p class="goals">Furthermore, I intend to delve deeper into cloud computing and DevOps practices over the next two years. Specifically, I aspire to become proficient in AWS services, leveraging the cloud's scalability and reliability to enhance the performance and efficiency of web applications. By integrating DevOps principles into my workflow, I aim to streamline development processes, automate deployments, and optimize infrastructure management. This journey will culminate in the creation of multiple projects that showcase my ability to leverage AWS tools effectively, reinforcing my reputation as a versatile frontend developer with robust backend and operational skills.
